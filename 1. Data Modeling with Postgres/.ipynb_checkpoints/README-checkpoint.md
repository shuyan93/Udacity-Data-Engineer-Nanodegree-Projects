# Introduction
A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, the team do not have an easy way to query their data because users' activity data and songs' data are residing in a directory of JSON logs.
 
The purpose of this project is to support the analytics team with their analystical goals, by creating creating a Postgres database with tables designed to optimize queries and ETL pipeline to optimize quries for song play analysis.


# Schema Design 

<ul>
    <li> Fact table  <html> <head> songplays </head> </html> </li> 
    
</ul> 

#Discuss the purpose of this database in the context of the startup, #Sparkify, and their analytical goals.
#State and justify your database schema design and ETL pipeline.
[Optional] Provide example queries and results for song play analysis.
